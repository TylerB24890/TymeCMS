TymeCMS
=======

A custom CMS built on the CodeIgniter PHP MVC Framework.

TymeCMS is a fully functional Content Management System built to make your websites easy to maintain.

Tyme allows you to create/edit/delete pages, blog posts, photos and more. If you are familiar with the CodeIgniter Framework
customizing this CMS will be a breeze. 

Simple add your database configuration files in /application/config/development/database.php
AND /application/config/development/database.php.

From there just upload the provided SQL file to your MySQL database and you're good to go!

The CMS is constantly under construction, so please remember to check back for updates. Currently I am creating more
default page templates such as an events page and photo gallery pages. I will also have a live demo up very soon.
